Hello incoming CSE15L students! This is how I got my ieng6 account to work on VS code!
 
The very first step will be downloading VS Code onto your desired laptop. I personally already had VS Code downloaded since I used it in previous CSE11 course. 
Yet, downloading VS Code should not be too difficult! it takes just a few clicks to instal just make sure you are installing it from the correct website 
and for your computer type: Mac, Windows, etc.! (you will soon learn about website URL's and how to detect phishing in the second week of class)

After this, you will also need to download git. Both Git and VS Code are essential to access your ieng6 account that you will use during your time in CSE15L. 
This is the last thing you will need to download and it is also very easy to do, just select your either the Windows or Mac version and you are set!

Once you have both of these perfect! You have all you need to acess your ieng6 acount! Now just close the VS Code window if you have one open 
and once you relaunch VS Code click "Terminal" on the top left corner and "New Teminal." Now click on the arrow next to the "+" icon on the terminal panel.
Since we installed git you will notice a new terminal type "Git Bash" click it and you should see a color coded terminal to type on.

Now for the moment we have all been waiting for! All you have to type in now is ssh followed by your ieng6 account user name with the format as follows: 
"ssh cs15lsp23xx@ieng6.ucsd.edu". Remember! all account names are pretty much identical only the 2 letters after "sp23" make your account unique, 
These 2 letters are pretty much the only thing you will have to remember apart from your passwork. Once you type this in you will get a prompt to type in your password,
The passwork will not appear on screen when you type it for safety reasons so make sure you get it right and do not make any typos!

Congrats! you have sucessfully acessed your ieng6 account! Good luck on your journey through CSE15L!!
