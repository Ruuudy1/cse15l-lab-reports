<h1>Grep Commands!<h1>
<h2> (found grep commands information on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)<h2>

<h3> The grep command is one of the most useful commands in bash. What the grep command does is find 
all the times the character of your choice is found in a .txt file. For example, in the ./technical directory used during last week's skill demo, 
we can use the following command on any file within it: <h3>

<h4>Example:
          
$ grep "definition" biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
          
          drawback of this simple definition of 'healthy' is that
          report results using only the simpler definition.
          
<h3>as we can see, this outputed the 2 lines that contain the characters "definition" which in this case it is seen in 2 times in this .txt file.
but there is other functionalities to the grep command.<h3>

<h2>-c command<h2>

<h3>For example if we arent interested on the whole line were the characters are included but rather just to count how many times the word appears we can add "-c"
right after grep.

When using this on the previous example we get:

<h4>     
Example 1 (1/2):
$ grep -c "definition" biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
          
2 
<h4>
          
this is as we expected since we saw previously that "definition" was only in this specific file twice which is why in this case we got the number 2. 
This command will come in handy when we have a very long output and rather of us counting the iines ourselves we only get the number of lines.<h3>

<h4>Example 1 (2/2):
Another useful way of using grep is by pairing it with the * in the filename/filetype to output exactly how mnay times that string appears in each file inside that folder:

without "-c":
          
$ grep "risks" government/Alcohol_Problems/*.txt
          
          government/Alcohol_Problems/Session3-PDF.txt:range from minimal to very sizeable reduction in risks that have
          government/Alcohol_Problems/Session3-PDF.txt:settings to reduce drinking and alcohol related risks. The first
          government/Alcohol_Problems/Session3-PDF.txt:multiple health risks (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, seat belt use),
          

with "-c":
          
$ grep -c "risks" government/Alcohol_Problems/*.txt
          
          government/Alcohol_Problems/DraftRecom-PDF.txt:0
          government/Alcohol_Problems/Session2-PDF.txt:0
          government/Alcohol_Problems/Session3-PDF.txt:3
          government/Alcohol_Problems/Session4-PDF.txt:0 
          
<h4>
          
          
<h2>-h command<h2>

<h3>at first I did not think this command did much as when I tried:<h3

<h4>$ grep -h "definition" biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
          
          drawback of this simple definition of 'healthy' is that
          report results using only the simpler definition.

          drawback of this simple definition of 'healthy' is that

<h4>
          
<h3> both commands seemed to produce the same output. Yet this command is really usefull paired with the "*" in the filename or filetype, 
As now we can look through ALL the files type .txt in biomed or any other folder without getting the file it is from in our output. <h3>

<h3> This is very useful when we want to quickly find/copy-paste over a line(s) a character is found at without having to take the time
to erase the path of every single one at a time. It also makes it slighty easier to read. <h3>
          
Example 2 (2/2):
          
without "-h" command:

<h2>-i command<h2>
          
<h3>Another useful command to truly get all outputs of a string of characters is "-i". This command does not take Capitalization (lowercase/undercase) into consideration 
when searching for a string. This is really usefull to truly find all words that match that character as many times some words inside the .txt file could be Capitalized (Hello) 
or in all Caps (HELLO) and normal grep will not find there if you only give write grep "hello" ... <h3>

<h2>-C(#) command<h2>

<h3>Finally, in my opinion the most useful command to use with grep is -C (capital C.) This command is really useful with grep
as when you see the lines before and after a string of characters of you choice giving you more context of what is going on when that word is mentioned. 
This is extremely essential as it lets you skim the text where you found that word quickly and efficiently as it separates the times the characters were found with "--"
and also very versatile as you get to pick how many lines foward and back from the string of characters you want to output.

          months, YHL has a reasonably continuous distribution. A
          drawback of this simple definition of 'healthy' is that

          death, since all are considered 'not healthy'. We also
